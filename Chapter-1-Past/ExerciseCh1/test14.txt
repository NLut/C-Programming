A flower is the reproductive structure found in flowering plants (plants of the division Angiospermae). Flowers consist of a combination of vegetative organs – sepals that enclose and protect the developing flower, petals that attract pollinators, and reproductive organs that produce gametophytes, which in flowering plants produce gametes. The colorful petals and sweet fragrances of many flowers have evolved to attract insects, birds, and other animals that help disperse pollen.
